In each row of the table, you can find the neighborhood's **number** (from 1 to 35), its **name** (e. g. \"Parioli\") and its **geographical coordinates** (latitude and longitude). Since I was not able to find a dataframe containing the geographical coordinates of each neighborhood, I visited the **Wikipedia** page https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartieri_di_Roma. There, I found a list of all the neighborhoods and by clicking on the neighborhood's name, I found its geographical coordinates in decimal form reported on the upper right side of the page. By copying this data for each neighborhood, I was finally able to create an xsl that I could work with on Python.\n\n\n2. I used the **Foursquare API** to find out the 10 most common venues for each neighborhood and saved this data in a dataframe in order to cluster the neighborhoods and visualize my results on a map."
